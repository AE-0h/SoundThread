[b]Functionality[/b]
SoundThread only supports mono and stereo .wav files.

Clicking and dragging on the soundfile viewer will let you select a section of audio to play.

If audio is selected in Input File when you run the thread, SoundThread will automatically cut out that section and process only that.

Clicking on the soundfile viewer while audio is playing will allow you to jump around the file to listen to different sections.

As it moves through the file it cuts out small chunks - called grains - of the file and plays those back. The length of those grains and how they fade in and out is set by the Grain Size, Attack and Decay. The pitch of the grains is set by Pitch Shift. 

How many grains play back is set by the Density, desities less than 1 will create gaps between grains, densities higher than 1 will cause grains to overlap and merge. 

Finally the sound can be panned from left to right with Panning and the overall level of the sound can be adjusted with Amplitude. 

This process works particularly well when automation is applied to many parameters to make it shift and change over time.

[b]Functionality[/b]
This process takes the sound and makes numerous copies of it, set by the number of layers. Each copy is sped up or slowed down by the transposition amount mulitplied by its layer number - -12 semitones = half speec, +12 semitones = double speed. These layers are then stacks on top of each other to create a denser sound. The attack offset is used to line up the layers so that their attacks all line up, adjust this to the point in the input where you want all the sounds to line up. The output duration allows you to trim off the end of the sound as with negative transposition and many layers the output can get very long.

[b]Functionality[/b]
This process 'blurs' detail in the time dimension by interpolating between the spectral envelope values of the start and end windows blurring windows. Note that it is not interpolating continuously over all the windows inbetween, just between the data in the start and end windows. The overall result is somewhat affected by just how different the data is in these two windows. The interpolation process produces a 'straight line' (linear) scale of values between the start and end points.

[b]Functionality[/b]
This process attempts to achieve a chorusing effect by randomising the amplitude and frequency values of the partials. If very large amplitude aspread values are used, the sound will turn to noise. The chorusing effect itself is achieved by values just a little above 1. Values of 2 or 3 begin to create a granular effect, and values of 10, 100 and 1000 create more and more noise.

Frequencies are sustained into subsequent windows. The overall effect is one of sustaining, but one which also makes the spectrum more complex.

The Glissandos parameter produces glissandos within the spectrum of the sound. Very effective slow glissandos are produced when gliss is near 0, e.g., -0.9 or 0.1. At 0.5, there are several glissandos, at 1, they are fairly fast, and at 10 it becomes a wash.

[b]Functionality[/b]
Looks for and retains only the N loudest partials in the analysis data on a window-by-window basis. This reduces the data in the spectral dimension and produces an aural 'trace' of the original sound.

With non-'noisy' sources it is necessary to reduce the number of channels quite considerably to make any appreciable aural change to the source sound. Even the 10 loudest channels will retain a surprising amount of the original sound. The flip-side of this is that HILITE TRACE can be used to 'clean' a sound, if a certain amount of data loss is not a problem. 

This works well with Blur after it to create a smeared simplified version of the sound.

[b]Functionality[/b]
Stretches or shrinks the sound over time, without changing frequency. It creates extra time-windows to expand the overall time-base of the sound, without a change of frequency. When using large stretch values you will make very long sound files and this process may take some time to run.

D-Ratio and D-Random allow you to randomise some of the channels in the sound to create internal variation and different timbres. Small amounts of this will blur the sound slightly and on long stretches help the sound feel less static. With large amounts of randomisation the texture of the sound starts to feel granular.

Inverts the spectral envelope, relative to the overall spectral envelope. This means that the energy asociated with the highest frequency bands is transferred to the lowest ones and vice versa. As the lowest partials in many sounds have the greatest amplitude and the highest ones the least, the result is typically a much brighter timbre.
