SoundThread only supports mono and stereo .wav files.

Clicking and dragging on the soundfile viewer will let you select a section of audio to play.

If audio is selected in Input File when you run the thread, SoundThread will automatically cut out that section and process only that.

Clicking on the soundfile viewer while audio is playing will allow you to jump around the file to listen to different sections.

Takes a wavecycle and divides its frequency, pitch shifting it down and making it slower. This longer wavecycle replaces the next few wavecycles keeping the length of the file the same.
